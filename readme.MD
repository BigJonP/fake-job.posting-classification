##### Requirements:
- Python environment 3.11
- IPython Notebook environment (jupyter notebooks or vs-code)
- Live internet connection when running notebook

##### Instructions:
1. Open "main.ipynb" in a IPython Notebook environment
2. Ensure the directory structure reamins unchanged
3. Run all cells
4. Variables of relevance:
    * best_model_1 = best performing model
    * best_model_2 = second best performing model
    * y_pred = predictions of best performing model
    * y_pred_2 = predicitons of second best performing model
